=== 0.3 / 2008-02-18

* Fixed a bug with proxied methods not being cleared.
* Fixed a bug where the same mocks were repeatedly being added to $facon_mocks.

=== 0.2 / 2008-02-13

* Use #after block to verify mocks so that the stack trace is more helpful (it now actually shows the line in the spec where the mock error occurred).

=== 0.1 / 2008-02-09

* First release!
